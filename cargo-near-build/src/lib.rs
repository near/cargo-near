#![allow(clippy::needless_lifetimes)]
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! * **build_external** -
//!   Exports [`crate::build_with_cli`] function which builds contracts by running external `cargo-near` binary
//!   with [`std::process::Command`]
//! * **build_internal** -
//!   The whole functionality, needed for build and ABI generation, mostly for internal use by `cargo-near` CLI implementation
//! * **docker** -
//!   Adds `docker` module for functionality of
//!   building in docker with WASM reproducibility.
//! * **test_code** -
//!   Adds exports needed for integration tests.
//!
//! ### Default features
//!
//! **build_external**
//!
//! ## Re-exports
//!
//! 1. [`camino`] is re-exported, because it is used in [`BuildOpts`] as type of some of fields
//! 2. [`near_abi`](https://docs.rs/near-abi/latest/near_abi/) is re-exported (under `build_internal` feature), because details of ABI generated depends on specific version of `near-abi` dependency  
//! 3. [`bon`] is re-exported for the convenience of [`bon::vec`] helper macro
//!
//! ## Sample usage:
//!
//! Default:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let artifact = cargo_near_build::build_with_cli(Default::default()).expect("some error during build");
//! ```
//!
//! With some options set:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let build_opts = cargo_near_build::BuildOpts::builder().features("some_contract_feature_1").build();
//! let artifact = cargo_near_build::build_with_cli(build_opts).expect("some error during build");
//! ```
