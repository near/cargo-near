#![allow(clippy::needless_lifetimes)]
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! * **abi_build** -
//!   Additional functionality, needed for build of ABI separately
//! * **docker** -
//!   Adds `docker` module for functionality of
//!   building in docker with WASM reproducibility.
//!
//! ### Default features
//!
//! None are enabled by default
//!
//! ## Re-exports
//!
//! 1. [camino] is re-exported, because it is used in [BuildOpts], and [BuildArtifact] as type of some of fields
//! 2. [near_abi] is re-exported, because details of ABI generated depends on specific version of `near-abi` dependency  
//! 3. [bon] is re-exported for the convenience of [bon::vec] helper macro
//!
//! ## Sample usage:
//!
//! Default:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let artifact = cargo_near_build::build(Default::default()).expect("some error during build");
//! ```
//!
//! With some options set:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let build_opts = cargo_near_build::BuildOpts::builder().features("some_contract_feature_1").build();
//! let artifact = cargo_near_build::build(build_opts).expect("some error during build");
//! ```
