## Usage

See `cargo near --help` for a complete list of available commands or run `cargo near` to dive into interactive mode. Help is also available for each individual command with a `--help` flag, e.g. `cargo near build --help`.

```console
cargo near
```

Starts interactive mode that will allow to explore all the available commands.

---

```console
cargo near new
```

Initializes a new project skeleton to create a contract from a template.

---

```console
cargo near build
```

Builds a NEAR smart contract along with its [ABI](https://github.com/near/abi) (while in the directory containing contract's Cargo.toml).

By default, this runs a reproducible build in a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) container, which:

1. runs against source code version, committed to git, ignoring any uncommitted changes
2. requires that `Cargo.lock` of project is created (e.g. via `cargo update`) and added to git. 
    - this enables `--locked` build by downstream `cargo` command. 
3. will use configuration in [`[package.metadata.near.reproducible_build]`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near/blob/main/cargo-near/src/commands/new/new-project-template/Cargo.toml.template#L17-L22) 
   section of contract's `Cargo.toml`
    - default values for this section can also be found in `Cargo.toml` of 
      template project, generated by `cargo near new`

Important flags:

1. `--no-docker`
    - flag can be used to perform a regular build with rust toolchain installed onto host, running the `cargo-near` cli. 
    - *NO*-Docker builds run against actual state of code in filesystem and not against a version, committed to source control.   

2. `--no-locked` 
    - flag is allowed in *NO*-Docker builds, e.g. to generate a `Cargo.lock` *and* simultaneously build the contract.
    - flag is allowed in Docker builds, but 
      - such builds are not reproducible due to potential update of dependencies and compiled `wasm` mismatch as a result

---

```console
cargo near abi
```

Generates NEAR smart contract's [ABI](https://github.com/near/abi) (while in the directory containing contract's Cargo.toml).

Once contract is deployed, this will allow you to call a view function `__contract_abi` to retrieve a [ZST](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)-compressed ABI.

---

```console
cargo near create-dev-account
```

Guides you through creation of a new NEAR account on [testnet](https://explorer.testnet.near.org).

---

```console
cargo near deploy
```

Builds the smart contract (equivalent to `cargo near build`) and guides you to deploy it to the blockchain.

By default, this runs a reproducible build in a Docker container. 

`deploy` command from Docker build requires that contract's source code:

1. doesn't have any modified tracked files, any staged changes or any untracked content.  
2. has been pushed to remote repository, identified by 
   [`source_code_git_url`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near/blob/main/cargo-near/src/commands/new/new-project-template/Cargo.toml.template#L22) field of `[package.metadata.near.reproducible_build]`.

Important flags:

1. `--no-docker`
    - flag can be used to perform a regular *NO*-Docker build *and* deploy. 
      - Similar to `build` command,  in this case none of the git-related concerns and restrictions apply.

2. `--no-locked` 
    - flag is declined for deploy, due to its effects on `build` result
